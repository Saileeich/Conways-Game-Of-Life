## Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life simulates an "ecosystem" where cells can both reproduce and die of under- and overpopulation.
The rules are:
1. Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbouring cells, wakes to life.
2. Any live cell that has less than 2 live neighbours, dies.
3. Any live cell that has more than 3 live neighbours, dies.

__!Attention!__
This code is highly unoptimized. I could code it more efficiently, but I am lazy. If you would like to run it yourself, you can change the width and height constants to alter the window size (again, I am lazy). And you can change the CELL_SIZE constant to alter the size of the cells.
